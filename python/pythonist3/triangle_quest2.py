"""
    You are given a positive integer NN. 
    Your task is to print a palindromic triangle of size NN.

    For example, a palindromic triangle of size 55 is:
    1
    121
    12321
    1234321
    123454321

    You can't take more than two lines. The first line (a for-statement) is already written for you. 
    You have to complete the code using exactly one print statement.

    Note: 
    Using anything related to strings will give a score of 00. 
    Using more than one for-statement will give a score of 00.

    Input Format
    A single line of input containing the integer NN.

    Constraints
    0<N<100<N<10

    Output Format
    Print the palindromic triangle of size NN as explained above.

    Sample Input
    5

    Sample Output:
    1
    121
    12321
    1234321
    123454321
